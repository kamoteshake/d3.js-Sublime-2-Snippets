d3.js-Sublime-2-Snippets
========================

My personal collection of d3.js code snippets for Sublime 2 (Time Saver!!!!)


HOW TO Install
==============
Browse to the following path on your UNIX system. Make sure you change the YOUR_USERNAME placeholder
with your current user.
```
cd /Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/User/
```

If the folder 'JavaScript' doesn't exisits inside of this folder, create it:
```
mkdir JavaScript
```
Enter this folder:
```
cd JavaScript
```

I recommend to checkout the repository directly in this folder:

```
git clone git@github.com:roundrobin/d3.js-Sublime-2-Snippets.git .
```

Now you will see inside of the ./JavaScript folder, a bunch of .sublime-snippet files.
Feel free to add new ones.
